## Data Mining Techniques for Customer Retention: A Churn Analysis
In an effort to understand and predict customer churn, I conducted an in-depth analysis of a telecommunications company's dataset. The dataset comprises various attributes such as customer demographics, account information, and service usage patterns. To extract meaningful insights, I employed diverse data mining techniques, including feature selection, data preprocessing, and machine learning model evaluation. By dividing the dataset into training and test sets, I assessed each model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores. This approach enabled me to identify the most effective model for predicting customer churn, ultimately aiming to enhance customer retention strategies.
